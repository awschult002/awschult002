Hi, I’m @awschult002
I’m interested in embedded C, VHDL, code optimization, processor acceleration, and shift and add algorithms.
I’m currently learning about graphics pipelining, Vulkan Shaders, and compute shaders.
I’m looking to collaborate on a full stack development, from CPU design and simulation to compilation of linux on that custom CPU.
